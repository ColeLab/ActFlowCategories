<b>Abstract</b>
<p align="justify"> In seeking to understand processes fundamental to brain function, the debate between localized versus distributed processing has persisted for over a century. Given recent evidence that distributed connectivity patterns are predictive of localized task-evoked activations, we hypothesized that even highly localized category-selective brain activations are primarily determined by the convergence of distributed brain processes. Consistent with this, we utilized fMRI data from N=352 human participants to find that distributed activity flow processes (specified by each region’s unique “connectivity fingerprint”) locally converge on visual cortex regions to confer the majority contribution to visual category selective responses to bodies, faces, places, and tools. This highlights a prominent role for functional network organization in the generation of localized visual category selectivity and provides evidence for a distributed convergence account of localized functionality in the human brain.</p>
